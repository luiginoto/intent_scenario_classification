# Intent and Scenario classification

The purpose of this project is to train an intent and scenario classifier that might be useful to support a chatbot. Intent and scenario lassification is an important component of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) systems in any chatbot platform.
As when you have an assistant and you tell him/her to book you a taxi, and your assistant knows how to respond for that query of yours because he/she has brain that trained for this, a chatbot providing assistance for a specific website has to be trained to respond for a particular query. To make a chatbot answer properly according to the users' question intent and scenario classifiers are developed and used.

The dataset used has been provided by [Open Search Network](https://www.opensearchnetwork.com) for an hackathon organized in collaboration with [Bocconi Students for Data Science](https://it.linkedin.com/company/bocconi-students-for-data-science), the organization I joined in order to enrich my competences in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning.

The dataset consists of 14514 questions with two labels, one determining the intent of the user and the other determining the scenario of the question. It is not a large dataset, however it is very well designed and contains a lot of information.
